# iot-healthcare-application

**Abstract**

Designed for both Android and iOS, this project amalgamates IoT capabilities, neuroscience insights, and mobile technology to develop a novel healthcare application. Utilizing EEG and pulse sensors as IoT 'things,' the app collects and analyzes brainwave and pulse data to assess potential schizophrenia indicators and monitor patient health remotely. This project aims to transform healthcare by enabling remote patient assessments, potentially reducing the need for physical presence during healthcare evaluations, providing at the same time a user-friendly experience.

Keywords: EGG, Graphs, Healthcare, Internet of Things, React Native, Disease Detection, Data Monitoring, Schizophrenia
